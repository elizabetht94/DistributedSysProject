# DistributedSysProject

Personal project which helped develop my knowledge on distributed systems. In this project in particular, I explored the Ray API and provided AWS autoscaler EC2 servers. In this project, I have created a simple multiplier application, which returns the result of all numbers multiplied by 2 within a given range. I mainly experimented with scaling the application, changing the ranges and observing the outcomes. 

To run this project, you must have AWS CLI configured. I utilised the following resources to get started:
